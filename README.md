Templates for the HOBO report assignment

Use this repository as a template to work on the HOBO report. It is designed to work on the exercises for the report collaboratively. 
This repo is a *template repository*, that means, you can create your own repo from this one, which will have the same structure. 
Then invite your collaborators to share the SQL code in the `./sql/` folder. The `main.tex` is a template for the report itself. 

Keep in mind, that the report is individual work. If you have an [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) account, you can import your report there directly 
to have a proper latex editor.

Feel free to add the instructor (@mmaelicke) to your copy or to mention me in your pull requests, code reviews, issues or discussions to 
get feedback.
